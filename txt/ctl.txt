<p>This is an interactive syllabus for Suffolk Law's project-based <a href="https://www.codingthelaw.org" target="_blank">Coding The Law</a> (2 experiential credits; Fall 2019, Mondays from 4-5:50pm in Sargent Hall, Room 325).

Q(1): What would you like to know?
A: Who should take this class
	Q(1.1):GOTO:problems
A: What students learn
	Q(learn): This course aims to place the use of new technologies (specifically the most hyped e.g., “AI” and data science) in the broader context of law and society.
	<br><br>Upon successful completion of this course, students will: 
	(1) Possess an introductory understanding of design thinking and its application to the practice of law, esp. in the development of legal tech;
	(2) Gain a high-level familiarity with the realm of the possible in legal tech, including a general understanding of data science and machine learning/narrow AI; and 
	(3) Understand the dangers and roots of algorithmic bias. <br><br>And more to the point, they'll learn by doing. It is after all a project-based course. 
	A: What does the work look like?
		Q(1.2.1):GOTO:work
	A: What are the course policies?
		Q(1.2.2):GOTO:policies
A: What the work looks like
	Q(work): We usually have weekly problem sets (mini coding projects), and there is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18gXLTOgY0x9loKwQuub6BzgVbnyyYkwmbHJg1FBKJZc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">final project</a>. How you engage with these depends in part on your background. Are you a non-coder/newbie or coder?
	A: Newbie/Non-coder
		Q(1.3.1): This course is not designed to make you into a production-ready coder. You will likely produce a project or two worthy of public release, but this will come largely from following directions and a lot of support. This is analogous to how most people can “bake” because they can follow a recipe. True bakers, however, know enough to improvise. They can innovate. For the most part, you will be following recipes.<br><br> The hope is that after this class you will better appreciate software creation as a skill, not some dark magic, and that this will help prepare you to partner with technologists to create just and useful solutions and ask the right questions. It should help acquaint you with the realm of the possible and provide you with a lay of the land. GOTO:studentwork
	A: Coder
		Q(1.3.2): You will be free, within certain constraints and after pre-approval, to deviate from our standard recipes and produce projects that utilize your existing skill set. But as we have made clear above, this course should primarily help pair your technical skill with the critical eye of a legal practitioner. GOTO:studentwork
A: If there's a textbook
	Q(wmd): Students need to have a copy of Cathy O'Neil’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction.html?id=5XqRDAEACAAJ" target="_blank">Weapons of Math Destruction</a>. Additional readings, media, and software, along with specific assignments are listed on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_pjMS1TgK4g6n4X5BuNdzVPySMVnyzD3TUUC2xFuyf0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Class, Reading, and Work Schedule</a>. 
	<br><br>Would you like to browse course policies?
	A: Yes
		Q(1.4.1):GOTO:policies
	A: No 
		Q(1.4.2): Thanks for visiting. Remember you can always "Go back one" or "start over." GOTO:bye
A: Course policies
	Q(policies): The authoritative and complete version of course policies can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KTzKR4t_ReKF_UovfMCYpfKMBELBRrZztqQBPgnYSQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. That being said, here are some highlights.
	A: Grading
		Q(grading): Your grade will be based primarily on a final project. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18gXLTOgY0x9loKwQuub6BzgVbnyyYkwmbHJg1FBKJZc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Final Project milestones & rubric</a>. Your performance on weekly problem sets and reading questions will be used as a multiplier such that your final grade will be either more or less than that of your final project. You can find the exact details <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KTzKR4t_ReKF_UovfMCYpfKMBELBRrZztqQBPgnYSQ/edit#heading=h.u9oiblabp1xj" target="_blank">here</a>.
		A: What about late work?
			Q(1.5.1.1):GOTO:latework
		A:[javascript:loadQnA('https://colarusso.github.io/faq/cats.html',this.innerHTML)] Can I have cat videos?
	A: Late work
		Q(latework): I am open to making adjustments to specific due dates for extenuating circumstances on a case by case basis as long as requests are made prior to the due date with adequate lead time (e.g., not the day something is due). If you are completing work late, you must let me know as I might not notice otherwise, and there are specific limits on how may assignments you can turn in late. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KTzKR4t_ReKF_UovfMCYpfKMBELBRrZztqQBPgnYSQ/edit#heading=h.u9oiblabp1xj" target="_blank">Grading/Evaluation</a> for more.

Q(problems): Do you think there are things about the way lawyers (or the justice system) work that could use improvement?
A: Yes
	Q(goodnews): Then you'd fit right in. We explore how tech can help improve things for practitioners and the justice system. <br><br>That being said, what's your comfort level with tech?
	A: I can use Word/Wordperfect
